## ‚úÖ Verify Setup

After adding the secrets:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test CI/CD workflow"
   git push origin develop
   ```

2. Check GitHub Actions:
   - Go to: https://github.com/tindevelopers/adminpanel-template-blog-writer-next-js/actions
   - Watch the workflow run
   - It should complete successfully and deploy to Vercel

3. Check deployment URL:
   - The workflow will post the deployment URL in the commit status
   - You can also check: https://vercel.com/tindeveloper/blog-writer-only

## üîç Current Project Info

- **Project Name**: blog-writer-only
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/tindeveloper/blog-writer-only

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails with "Invalid token"
- Make sure `VERCEL_TOKEN` is set correctly

- Ensure you have access to the team/organization
